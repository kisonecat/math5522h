The theme this week is \textbf{sequences and series of functions}
which provides an opportunity to consolidate our prior knowledge
(e.g., about Taylor series, about Laurent series), but also to push
forward with new terminology like \textbf{normal convergence}.

To formalize our results around Taylor series and Laurent series, look
in Palka's \textit{An Introduction to Complex Function Theory} for
\begin{itemize}
\item VII.1.1 Uniform Convergence
\item VII.1.2 Normal Convergence
\item VII.2.1 Complex Series
\item VII.2.2 Series of Functions
\item VII.3.1 General Results
\item VII.3.2 Limit Superior of a Sequence
\item VII.3.3 Taylor Series
\item VII.3.4 Laurent Series
\end{itemize}
or take a look at Ahlfors' \textit{Complex Analysis}, focusing on
\begin{itemize}
\item 5.1 Power Series Expansions
\item 5.1.1 Wierstrass's Theorem
\item 5.1.2 The Taylor Series
\item 5.1.3 The Laurent Series
\end{itemize}
Recall that Laurent series showed up when we were considering isolated
singularities.  We will review \textbf{uniform convergence} and then
study \textbf{normal convergence} which, unsurprisingly given then
terrible overuse of the word ``normal'' goes by other names (e.g.,
wouldn't ``pre-compact'' be a better name than ``normal family''?).
This culminates in \textbf{normal families} which you can study from
Palka's \textit{Complex Function Theory} in
\begin{itemize}  
\item VII.4.1 Normal Subfamilies of C(U)
\item VII.4.2 Equicontinuity
\item VII.4.3 The Arzela-Ascoli and Montel Theorems
\end{itemize}
I imagine you already saw Arzela-Ascoli in your real analysis course
(?), so Montel's theorem will provide an opportunity to connect to
your prior learning there.
